In my final year of engineering, I developed a system called Employee Recruitment System with Quiz. For this system, we conducted research in small firms, where the small business requires a workforce but, companies located in remote areas. They faced many problems for hiring workforce. For example, smaller developing companies often visit the college campus; but, they are not able to found caliber students and they have to pay a cost for exams and traveling. Hence, we developed a mobile application based on iOS. This application provides all features for hiring employees. In this application, Recruiter advertises their opening details, employees, and students get notification based on their interests. Here, employee fills the form and sends details to the recruiter. The exam will be conducted by the colleges where exam questions will be generated on mobiles. Each candidate gets different questions. Question paper generated and stored in QR-code. Here, just the company sends the QR-Code to the exam center and the exam will be conducted. Hence, the integrity of the exam is not compromised. Using exam results recruiters filter out candidates and candidates get a notification if they selected for further round.
